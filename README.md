# React/ES6 BoilerPlate

Uses:

- Styled Components
- Yarn
- Webpack 4
- Node 10
- Eslint (with my own extra rules, easy to replace/reconfigure)
- Jest/Enzyme for testing

- Built-in BrowserSync
- Pre commit and pre push hooks to locally lint and test your code respectively
- Code splitting
- Babel is already preconfigured for as much cross browser support as I could think of, reccomendations are welcome though!


## Installation

Open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash

yarn install

`yarn start` - will start up your local environment
`yarn build` - bundles your project ready for production
`yarn test` - runs your tests
`lint-js` - runs Eslint across the whole project

```
Project is served at `localhost:8080`
